	<p>Very nice and good movie, i like this movie because there is an interesting story, great actors - especially the beloved Jackie Chan. I think there is no such person who doesn't like or didn't watch movies with his participation.</p>
	<p>The story tells that: crazy English scientist Phileas Fogg decided to argue with Lord Kelvin that he can travel around the world in 80 days. And although, sometimes, the situation seems hopeless, our hero will always find out of the predicament.</p>
	<p>Also not to mention Arnold Schwarzenegger as a spoiled and narcissistic Prince,who was pleasantly surprised by his acting.<br>To sum up, I definitely advise you to watch this film, it'll give you a positive charge for the whole day.</p>
